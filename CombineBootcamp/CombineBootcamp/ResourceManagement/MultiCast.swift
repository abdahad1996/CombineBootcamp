//MARK: MultiCast() operator
//This operator builds on share() and uses a Subject of your choice to publish values to subscribers. The unique characteristic of multicast(_:) is that the publisher it returns is a ConnectablePublisher. What this means is it wonâ€™t subscribe to the upstream publisher until you call its connect() method. This leaves you ample time to set up all the subscribers you need before letting it connect to the upstream publisher and start the work.

//A multicast publisher, like all ConnectablePublishers, also provides an autoconnect() method, which makes it work like share(): The first time you subscribe to it, it connects to the upstream publisher and starts the work immediately. This is useful in scenarios where the upstream publisher emits a single value and you can use a CurrentValueSubject to share it with subscribers.

    var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    @Published var publisher1 = [Int]()
    @Published var publisher2 = [Int]()

    
    //no delay needeed like share operator
