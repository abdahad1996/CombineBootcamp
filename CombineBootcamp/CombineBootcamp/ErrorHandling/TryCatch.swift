//If you want the ability of the catch operator but also want to be able to throw an error, then tryCatch is what you need.
//Can I use tryMap on a non-error throwing pipeline?
//No. Upstream from the tryCatch has to be some operator or publisher
//that is capable of throwing errors. That is why you see tryMap upstream
//from tryCatch. Otherwise, Xcode will give you an error
