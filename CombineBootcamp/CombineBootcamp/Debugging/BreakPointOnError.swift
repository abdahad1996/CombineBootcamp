//Use the breakpointOnError when you are interested in having Xcode pause execution when ANY error is thrown within your pipeline. While developing, you may
//have a pipeline that you suspect should never throw an error so you donâ€™t add any error handling on it. Instead, you can add this operator to warn you if your

//pipeline did throw an error when you were not expecting it to.

//Your assumption is that this
//should never happen. If it does
//happen, Xcode will pause
//execution with the debugger.
