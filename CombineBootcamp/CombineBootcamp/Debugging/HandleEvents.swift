//There are some events you have access to with the sink subscriber such as when it receives a value or when it cancels or completes. But what if youâ€™re not using a
//sink subscriber or if you need access to other events such as when a subscription is received or a request is received?
//This is where the handleEvents operator can become useful. It is one operator that can expose 5 different events and give you closures for each one so you can write
//debugging code or other code
//as you will see in the following examples.


//The receiveCompletion in this
//example will not execute because there is an
//error is being thrown
