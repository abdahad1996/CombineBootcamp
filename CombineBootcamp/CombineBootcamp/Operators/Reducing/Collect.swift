//The collect operator wonâ€™t let items pass through the pipeline. Instead, it will put all items into an array, and then when the pipeline finishes it will publish the

//MARK: Collect  Count

//You can pass a number into the collect operator and it will keep collecting items and putting them into an array until it reaches that number and then it will publish
//the array. It will continue to do this until the pipeline finishes.


//MARK: Collect by Time or Count - View
//When using collect you can also set it with a time interval and a count. When one of these limits is reached, the items collected will be published.
