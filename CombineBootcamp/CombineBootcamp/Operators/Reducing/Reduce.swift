//The reduce operator gives you a closure to examine not only the current item coming down the pipeline but also the previous item that was returned from the
//reduce closure. After the pipeline finishes, the reduce function will publish the last item remaining.
//If youâ€™re familiar with the scan operator you will notice the functions look nearly identical. The main difference is that reduce will only publish one item at the end.
